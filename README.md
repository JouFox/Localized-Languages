# Localized-Languages
Localized Languages (LoLa) is a context overhaul script for playing AI Dungeon in your language of choice. LoLa also improves player inputs and supports (optional) Auto-Cards integration. Itâ€™s free and open-source for anyone to use however they see fit. Creators are welcome to use LoLa for multilingual accessibility in their published scenarios.
